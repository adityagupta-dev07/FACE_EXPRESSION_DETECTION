# FACE_EXPRESSION_DETECTION
# 🎭 Face Expression Detection System

A **real-time Facial Expression Detection Web Application** developed using **Python, Flask, OpenCV, and Deep Learning**.  
This system detects human emotions from facial expressions using a webcam and displays the predicted emotion live on a web interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

Facial expressions play a crucial role in human communication.  
This project aims to bridge the gap between humans and machines by enabling computers to **understand human emotions visually**.

Using **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**, the system:
- Detects faces from live video
- Classifies emotions accurately
- Displays results instantly in a web browser

This project is ideal for learning **AI + ML + Web Integration**.
