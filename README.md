# FACE_EXPRESSION_DETECTION
# 🎭 Face Expression Detection System

A **real-time Facial Expression Detection Web Application** developed using **Python, Flask, OpenCV, and Deep Learning**.  
This system detects human emotions from facial expressions using a webcam and displays the predicted emotion live on a web interface.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Facial expressions play a crucial role in human communication.  
This project aims to bridge the gap between humans and machines by enabling computers to **understand human emotions visually**.

Using **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**, the system:
- Detects faces from live video
- Classifies emotions accurately
- Displays results instantly in a web browser

This project is ideal for learning **AI + ML + Web Integration**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect human faces in real-time
- Classify facial expressions into emotions
- Display emotions visually on a web UI
- Build an easy-to-use and extensible system
- Demonstrate practical use of ML in real-world applications

🚀 Deploy on Your Own Laptop (Step-by-Step)

This section explains how any user can deploy this project on their own laptop.

🔹 Step 1: Download the Project
Option 1: Using Git (Recommended)
git clone https://github.com/adityagupta-dev07/FACE_EXPRESSION_DETECTION.git
cd FACE_EXPRESSION_DETECTION
Option 2: Without Git

Click Code → Download ZIP on GitHub

Extract the ZIP file

Open the extracted folder in Terminal / Command Prompt

🔹 Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Important)

This keeps dependencies isolated.
python -m venv venv
Activate it:

Windows

venv\Scripts\activate


Linux / macOS

source venv/bin/activate
🔹 Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


⏳ This may take a few minutes (TensorFlow install).

🔹 Step 4: Run the Application
python app.py


If everything is correct, you will see something like:
Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
🔹 Step 5: Open in Browser
Open any browser and go to:

cpp
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000
🔹 Step 6: Allow Camera Access
Allow webcam permission when asked

Face detection will start automatically

Emotion will be shown live on screen

🎉 Project successfully deployed on your laptop!

🧠 How the System Works (Simple)
Webcam captures video frames

OpenCV detects faces

ML model predicts emotion

Emotion is displayed live on web page
